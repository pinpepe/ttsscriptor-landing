Last Updated: November 15, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy carefully before using the TTS Scriptor application (the "Service") operated by us. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

**By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.**

## 1. Description of Service

TTS Scriptor ("the Application") is a web-based tool that runs in your browser. It allows you to convert text scripts into audio files by communicating directly from your computer to third-party Text-to-Speech (TTS) services, including but not limited to Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for Speech and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. The Application requires you to provide your own API keys for these third-party services, which are stored locally on your device.

## 2. User Accounts

**Account Creation:** You must create an account to access the Service's full functionality, including saving projects to the cloud and managing subscriptions. You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for any activities or actions under your account.

## 3. API Keys and Project Data (Client-Side Storage)

A core principle of TTS Scriptor is user privacy and control. Your sensitive data is managed directly by you, on your own computer.

**API Key Responsibility:**
*   **Local Storage:** Your API keys for third-party services (Azure, Google, etc.) are stored **only in your web browser's local storage on your computer**. They are never transmitted to or stored on our servers. This gives you maximum security and control.
*   **Security:** Because your keys are stored on your device, you are solely responsible for securing the computer and browser you use to access the Service. Do not use the Service on public or untrusted computers.
*   **Costs and Usage:** All usage costs billed by third-party providers are your sole responsibility. Since API calls are made directly from your browser to the provider, TTS Scriptor has no role in this billing relationship. We strongly recommend you monitor your usage and set up billing alerts in your Azure and Google Cloud accounts.

**Project Data and Backups:**
*   **Local Management:** Your scripts and project data are managed and stored within your browser session. The Service provides tools to save your projects as files directly onto your computer.
*   **Data Backup Responsibility:** You are **solely responsible for saving and backing up your work**. Since project data is not stored on our servers, we have no way to recover lost data. **We strongly advise you to save your projects to your local disk frequently to prevent data loss.**

## 4. Subscriptions and Payments

Certain features of the Service may require a paid subscription.

*   **Billing:** We use a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to handle all subscription payments. We do not store your credit card details. By subscribing, you agree to Stripe's terms of service.
*   **Subscription Plans:** We offer the following plans:
    *   **15-Day Trial:** A one-time payment of $0.50 USD for 15 days of full access. After this period, access will be paused unless you subscribe to a monthly or yearly plan.
    *   **Monthly Subscription:** A recurring payment of $4.00 USD per month.
    *   **Yearly Subscription:** A recurring payment of $40.00 USD per year.
*   **Automatic Renewal:** Monthly and Yearly subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel your subscription before the renewal date. You can manage your subscription through the customer portal provided after your purchase.
*   **Refunds:** All payments are non-refundable. If you cancel a subscription, you will retain access to the paid features until the end of your current billing period.
*   **Price Changes:** We reserve the right to change our subscription prices at any time. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any price changes.
