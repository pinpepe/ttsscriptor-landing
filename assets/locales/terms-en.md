Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy carefully before using the TTS Scriptor application (the "Service") operated by us. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

**By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.**

## 1. Description of Service

TTS Scriptor ("the Application") is a tool that allows users to convert text scripts into audio files by integrating with third-party Text-to-Speech (TTS) services, including but not limited to Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for Speech and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. The Application requires users to provide their own API keys for these third-party services.

## 2. User Accounts and API Keys

**Account Creation:** You must create an account to access the Service. You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for any activities or actions under your account.

**API Key Responsibility:** The core functionality of the Service relies on your personal API keys from third-party providers (Azure, Google, etc.). You are solely responsible for:

*   **Security:** The safekeeping and confidentiality of your API keys. We store these keys in an encrypted format, but you must not share them or expose them publicly. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your API keys.
*   **Costs and Usage:** All usage costs, fees, and charges incurred through the use of your API keys are your sole responsibility. TTS Scriptor is not responsible for any charges billed to you by third-party service providers. We strongly recommend you monitor your usage and set up billing alerts in your Azure and Google Cloud accounts.
*   **Compliance:** Your use of third-party services must comply with their respective terms of service. TTS Scriptor is not liable for any violation of these terms on your part.

## 3. User Data and Content

**Data Backup and Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for the content you create and process through the Service (e.g., scripts, projects, generated audio files). While we strive to maintain the integrity of our platform, we are not responsible for any loss, corruption, or deletion of your data.

*   **We strongly advise you to regularly back up your projects and important data.** The Service provides functionality to save and load projects to your local machine, and you should use it frequently to prevent data loss.

**Content Ownership:** You retain all ownership rights to the scripts you write and the audio you generate. We do not claim any ownership over your content.

## 4. Privacy Policy

### Information We Collect

*   **Account Information:** When you register, we collect your email address.
*   **API Keys:** We collect and store your encrypted API keys to facilitate communication with third-party services on your behalf.
*   **Project Data:** We store your script and project data to provide the core functionality of the application.
*   **Usage Data:** We may collect anonymous data about your interaction with the Service to improve its functionality.

### How We Use Your Information

*   To provide, maintain, and improve the Service.
*   To manage your account and provide you with customer support.
*   To communicate with you about your account or updates to the Service.
*   To process payments for subscriptions through our payment processor (Stripe).

### Data Protection and Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information. Your API keys and account password are encrypted in our database. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, except:

*   To trusted third parties who assist us in operating our Service (e.g., payment processors like Stripe), so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
*   To comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall TTS Scriptor, its affiliates, agents, directors, or employees, be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, this Service.

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.

## 6. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

## 7. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
